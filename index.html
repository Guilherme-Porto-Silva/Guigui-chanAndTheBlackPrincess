                        This level is a shadowashed and infinite castle interior which's corredors go on forever. The walls are black but not pitch, the ground is made out of planks from a dark wood, there are carpets in most of the rooms, red with white borders.

                        There are many windows, but no light comes from them, only from the lamps at the roof. If a lantern is pointed on a window, it's holder can see an infinite expand of a faded, black grass, a dark field with not many high differences. This field is inaccessible, as breaking walls or windows takes you to level You Cheated! and no-cliping has, so far, shown itself to be impossible in this level. The sky outside is mostly pitch black, but there are a few red glowing flying balls, presumebly far away gigantic stars, in some points.

                    <h1>Black Princess</h1>
                    <p>
                        Single entity, humanoid and level exclusive, The Princess is a two meters tall porter of red glowing eyes with orange iris and yellow pupils, who aways wears black and blank clothing, sometimes with red or purple details. Her hair has color of shadows and her skin is blank, darker blank than that of stone. Both are very smooth. Her nails are black as well, and indestructible apparently: have been seen opening holes in metal trough scratching patiently. Her ears are sharp like those of an elf and the color of her tooth is an oxided cooper blue. Upon encountering The Princess, you will be asked to sit down and have a nice friendly conversation with her for a bit, trhough a polite and very calm way of talking. If the offer is denied, The Princess will express her sadness in a way that depends on how exatly the deniing was done: if the visiter was rude, she will be a bit angry and tell them they can stay as far from her as they want, but if they were as polite as she has been to them, she keeps up  that calmness and tells them they are welcome to come back at any time they want. By accepting the offer or coming back to say their mind has changed, the visiter is teleported to an expecific room of the level that can only be acsced trhough that way. It's still unknown if this room counts as a sublevel of if is just an isolated part of the same level, but it's called "Pricess' Drink Room". Circular - raio de X metros - and made out of the same black stone walls and dark wood planks floor, the Princess's Drinking Room has a circular table in its middle, made out of an extremaly resistent withe material and four square triangles of blank glass. There is a pot on the middle of the table, aparently made out a dark purple clay or concrete, in wich lives a not very small but also not gigantic plant with blank stalk and magenta petals, last having dark green borders. On a wall of the room is a black doble door with silver-color holders and frame, to wich if you go The Princess asks if you are alredy leaving her.  There's some tipe of bar on another, not oposite, side of the room, a retangular hole that shows bar stuff. In the other side of the balcon is some tipe of shadowy humanoid, to wich The Princess talks by calling "Gilbery". It's a brewer and server with a demonic voice that can only be heard when it murmurs, as it doesn't ever say words. With red glowing small eyes, pich black skin and unsenable - presumed to be black as well - tooth, Gilbery almost doesn't move when no atending an ask, and acts like been acostumeded to the ideia of his job been to serve those who sit next to the circular table. When it puts what has been required on the withe balcon, stuff literatly teleports to the table at the middle of the room, wich is not too close to it, there being one second of dalay. If the visiter begins to leave the chair to go get what they asked from the balcon, The Princess tells them Gilbery will bring it to them, making people belive they objects teleport due to a power used by Gilbery itself. In fact, The Princess never likes when a person lifts the chair they are sitting on in The Princess' Drinking Room, aways telling them not to leave her and to stay at least a bit more. She also insists for them to keep drinking alcahol, repeatly offering them diferent types of drinks and kindly asking them to take'em. If the visiter claims to not enjoy alcahol, The Princess will express sadness, and the person will be teleported back to the main part of the level without the entity. If The Princess gets tired of talking and drinking with the visiter while last is still with their mental facultys minimaly in place, the entity will thank them for the fun brought to her they and tell them they are welcome to come back any time they want. The visiter will then be telepoted to a bright version of the castle they were in before meeting The Princess, it is thouht to be a sub level and has been classified as dificulty 0. Now, if human passes out before runig out her talking material, they wake up in a red version of the same castle there is also belived to be a sublevel, but that had its dificulty classified as 5. If they claim need of going to bathroom, The Princess will claim that she will be waiting for their return and the person will be teleported to a very small saquare bathroom with dark brown walls and ground made out of different color planks. It feels stuffy there and must be around 301° kelvin, the toilet is blank and there is a shower box, but sad has no door or any cover. The smell of this bathroom is just awfull, feeling like lots of people have once vomited there and all their smells have acumulated during the centries.
    You can actualy befriend The Princess when talking to her: she's been known to like talking about alcaholic drinks in general and therefore people who show knolege about those poisons, to pefer calm and classy people over exited and exageretedly extroverted ones and to hate those who keep asking about the Backrooms, might it be about what it is, about how it works, its origens... You must foucus your attention on topics two people in the Frontrooms who never even heard about the Backrooms would talk about, most specialy alcaholic drinks. Their hystory, how they work, wich you like the most, things like that.

                            This event happens at random times and only if there's no one interecting with The Princess. It causes the walls to become red from a second to the other and the windows to become orange. The sky begins to glow yellow and the carpets become orange with yellow borders. A machine soundtrack to begins play through out the entire level, being the people who are inside unable to identify where it comes from. The Solar Adamantiums spawn while the level is like that, and begging unespawning when it goes back to normal, but they spawn in a much higher rete then unespawn. During the event, the medium temperature of the level in the absolute scale rises from 283° to 306°

                        There is a structure that can be found in levels with a not very small city theme, a photograph of one of them - just one is enough, since they are all the same, as if the Backrooms loaded the same file to generate them all - is attached to the file. There is always a faceling inside it, as if it were in charge of serving customers, and, even if it is murdered, it will simply cease to exist from one second to the next and, five seconds later, also reappear instantly, completely intact and - for all practical effect - no memories of having died. Whoever asks such a faceling to serve him, as if he were his client, will be teleported to the castle of darkness, after the entity makes a movement with his hands usually done by people who say "Let it to me!" while they do it.
